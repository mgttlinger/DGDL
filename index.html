<h3>About DGDL</h3>
<p>The Dialogue Game Description Language (DGDL) is a tool for describing and working with dialogue games. The aim of DGDL is to provide a basis for the rapid development, testing, and deployment of dialogue games and related communication protocols. The core of DGDL is a grammar that enables the syntactically correct description of dialogue game protocols. This core is supplemented by a growing collection of tools for validating, verifying, testing, deploying, and managing dialogue game protocols, dialogue games, and dialogues</p>

<p>DGDL is based upon work initially performed by Simon Wells in the course of researching his Ph.D thesis entitled "Dialogue Games in Multiagent Argumentation".</p>
